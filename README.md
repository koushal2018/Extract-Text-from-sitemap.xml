# Extract-Text-from-sitemap.xml
a python script that can take sitemap.xml and extract the content from the urls from the xml output

xml.etree.ElementTree to parse the sitemap.xml.
requests to fetch content from the URLs.
Optionally, BeautifulSoup (from the bs4 library) to parse the content fetched from the URLs.

Replace path_to_sitemap.xml with the path to your sitemap file.

This script will provide you with a dictionary (contents) where the keys are the URLs and the values are the text content extracted from those URLs.

Note: Make sure you install the required libraries (requests and bs4) before running this script.

With this addition, the extracted content will be saved to a file named extracted_contents.txt. Each URL and its corresponding content will be separated by a line of = characters. You can adjust the formatting and filename as desired.
